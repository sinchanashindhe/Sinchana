    qiuestion 1 platform independent doesnot depends upon any platform it can be run in different platform 
eg: bytecode is the platform independent variable it can converts the .java to class java.


    question 2         primitive:    * primitive datatype can hold the simple datatypes and they dont have 
			                the members in the primitive datatypes  
                            * primitive datatypes consists of 8 datatypes
                            * primitive data types doesnot contain thestates and behaviour
							eg:byte
							   int
							   short
							   float
							   long
							   double
							   boolean
							   char
							
							
							
			non primitive:  *nonprimitive datatypes having states and behaviour
                             *non primitive data types consists of n number of datatypes
							 eg: Array,string
							 
							 
	
	question 3 class is collection of objects and these objective contains states and behaviour
	            any program which contains states and behaviour
				it is the syntax which can be started as classname
				eg:
				class javatest{
					
				}
				here javatest is the class name
	
	
	           members it is the object living or non living things
			   objects means  whatever we visible in real world
			   object having 2 types namely
			   *states
			   *behaviour
			   eg:
			   
	question 6 main method is the metod in which the heap memory ther is a stack ,meatspace,constant pool
             and instant pool,class loader
           stack memeory is the method in which they execute the program
           	class loader in this the class name are stored	
			constant pool in this memeory we store the numerical values
			instant pool is the memory in which the they stored the

	question 8 class Time{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			float hours=24f;
			float  seconds=3600f;
			System.out.println("Hours into seconds")
			
		}
		
		
	}	   
		
question 7 class Reverse{
